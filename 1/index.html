<h2>--- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---</h2>

<p>Something is wrong with global snow production, and you&#39;ve been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they&#39;ve used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all&nbsp;<em>fifty stars</em>&nbsp;by December 25th.</p>

<p>Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants&nbsp;<em>one star</em>. Good luck!</p>

<p>You try to ask why they can&#39;t just use a&nbsp;<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1">weather machine</a>&nbsp;(&quot;not powerful enough&quot;) and where they&#39;re even sending you (&quot;the sky&quot;) and why your map looks mostly blank (&quot;you sure ask a lot of questions&quot;)&nbsp;and&nbsp;hang on did you just say the sky (&quot;of course, where do you think snow comes from&quot;) when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet" target="_blank">trebuchet</a>&nbsp;(&quot;please hold still, we need to strap you in&quot;).</p>

<p>As they&#39;re making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been&nbsp;<em>amended</em>&nbsp;by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.</p>

<p>The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific&nbsp;<em>calibration value</em>&nbsp;that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the&nbsp;<em>first digit</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>last digit</em>&nbsp;(in that order) to form a single&nbsp;<em>two-digit number</em>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
<code>1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are&nbsp;<code>12</code>,&nbsp;<code>38</code>,&nbsp;<code>15</code>, and&nbsp;<code>77</code>. Adding these together produces&nbsp;<code><em>142</em></code>.</p>

<p>Consider your entire calibration document.&nbsp;<em>What is the sum of all of the calibration values?</em></p>

<p><mark>Solution: <output id="solutionanswer"></p>
<script type="module">
import solution from "./solution.js"
const response = await fetch("input.txt")
const input = await response.text()
solutionanswer.value = JSON.stringify(solution(input))
</script>

<h2>--- Part Two ---</h2>

<p>Your calculation isn&#39;t quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually&nbsp;<em>spelled out with letters</em>:&nbsp;<code>one</code>,&nbsp;<code>two</code>,&nbsp;<code>three</code>,&nbsp;<code>four</code>,&nbsp;<code>five</code>,&nbsp;<code>six</code>,&nbsp;<code>seven</code>,&nbsp;<code>eight</code>, and&nbsp;<code>nine</code>&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;count as valid &quot;digits&quot;.</p>

<p>Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:</p>

<pre>
<code>two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the calibration values are&nbsp;<code>29</code>,&nbsp;<code>83</code>,&nbsp;<code>13</code>,&nbsp;<code>24</code>,&nbsp;<code>42</code>,&nbsp;<code>14</code>, and&nbsp;<code>76</code>. Adding these together produces&nbsp;<code><em>281</em></code>.</p>

<p><em>What is the sum of all of the calibration values?</em></p>

<p><mark>Part 2: <output id="part2answer"></p>
<script type="module">
import { part2 } from "./solution.js"
const response = await fetch("input.txt")
const input = await response.text()
part2answer.value = JSON.stringify(part2(input))
</script>
